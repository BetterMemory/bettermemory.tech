    "title": "Watching videos vs. reading, why we choose reading.",
    "date": "17.January 2025",
    "author": "VinKon",
    "content": "Learners commonly acquire knowledge through two primary methods: watching videos or reading text. Based on our research and analysis, we found that videos, as a medium for delivering information, often prioritize engagement and completion rates during production. While this approach helps capture the audience's attention, it also results in lower information density. As a result, the effectiveness of video-based learning can sometimes be suboptimal.",
    "content-2": "Given this observation, we chose not to adopt the video-based educational model commonly used by platforms such as * in our product development. Instead, we opted for a text-centered approach to information delivery.",
    "content-3": "When watching videos, users are required to process multiple streams of input simultaneously, such as visual content, background music, narration, and subtitles. This multitasking nature of video consumption can easily distract the learner's attention. In contrast, reading text allows users to focus more effectively, as it usually occurs in a quiet environment with information limited to the written content. Consequently, text-based information delivery proves to be significantly more efficient than video-based methods."
